## Homework 6 Write a function

Analyzing protein drug interactions by reading in any protein PDB data and outputs a plot for the specified protein.

```{r}
# this function takes in protein PDB data as string and outputs a plot for the input protein
# data_name: string, the name of the data
# output: a figure
draw_protein = function(data_name){
  data = read.pdb(data_name) # read in the data
  data.chainA = trim.pdb(data,chain="A", elety = "CA")
  data.b = data.chainA$atom$b
  plotb3(data.b, sse= data.chainA, typ="l",ylab="Bfactor")
}
```

Here is a demonstration of how to use the function:
```{r}
library(bio3d)
# call the function with data name as the parameter
draw_protein("4AKE")
draw_protein("1AKE")
draw_protein("1E4Y")
```
